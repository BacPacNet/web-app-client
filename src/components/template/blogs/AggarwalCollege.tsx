          <BlogParagraph>
            Aggarwal College, Ballabgarh is a post-graduate co-educational college aided by the Haryana Government and affiliated to M.D. University,
            Rohtak. The college was established in 1971 under the aegis of Aggarwal Vidya Pracharni Sabha and has grown into one of the recognised
            higher education institutions in the Faridabad-Ballabgarh region.
          </BlogParagraph>
          <BlogParagraph>
            The institution is recognised under Section 2(f) and 12(B) of the UGC Act, 1956, is AICTE-approved, and holds NAAC A++ accreditation with
            a CGPA of 3.57. The college was also awarded &quot;College with Potential for Excellence&quot; status by UGC in 2016.

        <BlogSection title="A Campus Built Around Access, Academics and Student Development">
          <BlogParagraph>
            Aggarwal College is situated in Ballabgarh, Faridabad, on the Delhi-Faridabad-Ballabgarh corridor. That location matters because it gives
            students connectivity to the broader Delhi NCR education and career ecosystem, while also serving the local student population in
            Faridabad and Ballabgarh.
          </BlogParagraph>
          <BlogParagraph>
            The college positions itself around academic excellence, modern infrastructure, values, skills and holistic development. Its public pages
            mention a fully air-conditioned, Wi-Fi-enabled campus, smart classrooms, modern computer labs, a classic auditorium, library and
            e-resources, sports and cultural activities, NCC, NSS, YRC, RRC, safety cells, counselling support, industry exposure, internships and
            expert talks.

          <BlogParagraph>
            The college&apos;s event pages show a wide range of activity: scholarship and admission programmes, anti-addiction and anti-terrorism
            rallies, water awareness campaigns, farewell ceremonies, GST seminar activity, self-defense and empowerment, healthcare-industry sessions,
            World Book Day library events, Sanskrit council activity, investment banking career counselling, World Earth Day, emerging technology
            sessions, IPR activities, poster competitions, national workshops, nukkad natak, online quizzes, finance workshops, moot court activity,
            Aryabhatta Club activity, guest lectures, job fair activity, athletic meet activity and more.
          </BlogParagraph>
          <BlogParagraph>
            That matters because the future of higher education is not only about uploading notes online. It is about making sure students can
            discover the opportunities already happening around them.

          title="Why Aggarwal College Wanted a More Centralised Digital Campus Space"

          <BlogParagraph>
            From our conversations and partnership work, one thing became clear: Aggarwal College is not trying to remain stuck in old communication
            habits. The college is open to change and willing to try newer, more efficient platforms if they can genuinely make student life easier.
          </BlogParagraph>
          <BlogParagraph>
            The need was practical. A college with many courses, departments and activities should not have student communication scattered
            everywhere. Different courses need their own spaces. Clubs need visibility. Official updates need reach. Students should be able to find
            events, groups and opportunities without depending only on word of mouth.
          </BlogParagraph>
          <BlogParagraph>That is where the Unibuzz × Aggarwal College partnership began to make sense.</BlogParagraph>

          imageAlt="What Unibuzz is"
        >
          <BlogParagraph>
            Unibuzz is not Moodle. It is not trying to replace academic learning management systems, ERP platforms or formal administrative tools.
          </BlogParagraph>
          <BlogParagraph>
            Moodle and similar systems are usually built around courses, assignments, resources, submissions and academic workflows. They are useful
            for structured teaching and learning.
          </BlogParagraph>
          <BlogParagraph>
            Unibuzz is different. It is closer to a verified campus communication and community layer — more comparable in spirit to tools like Teams,
            Slack or a private digital campus network, but designed specifically for universities and colleges.

          imageAlt="Partnership helped Unibuzz grow"
        >
          <BlogParagraph>This partnership did not only help Aggarwal College. It also helped Unibuzz mature as a product.</BlogParagraph>
          <BlogParagraph>
            In the early version of Unibuzz, the assumption was simple: students would individually sign up, find their university, verify themselves
            and join. That can work for some cases, but after conversations with Aggarwal College and multiple other colleges, we realised something
            important.
          </BlogParagraph>
          <BlogParagraph>
            Institutions do not want extra burden. They do not want to spend weeks explaining a new platform, chasing signups or manually organising
            every student into the right spaces.
          </BlogParagraph>
          <BlogParagraph>So Unibuzz evolved.</BlogParagraph>
        </BlogSection>

        <BlogSection title="Our 3-Year MOU with Aggarwal College">
          <BlogParagraph>
            Unibuzz and Aggarwal College are working under a 3-year MOU. The goal is not to force a sudden change overnight. The goal is to implement
            Unibuzz slowly but steadily in a way that fits the college&apos;s existing environment.
          </BlogParagraph>
          <BlogParagraph>
            This is important because real digital transformation in colleges does not happen by simply launching a platform. It happens when faculty,
            students, departments, clubs and administrators can actually use the platform without feeling that it has become another burden.
          </BlogParagraph>
          <BlogParagraph>That is the spirit of this partnership: practical change, not performative digitalisation.</BlogParagraph>

          imageAlt="Genuine collaboration"
        >
          <BlogParagraph>
            For Unibuzz, Aggarwal College is not just another college name on a partner list. It is one of the institutions that helped us better
            understand what colleges actually need from a digital campus platform.
          </BlogParagraph>
          <BlogParagraph>
            Aggarwal College wanted a more centralised place for its different courses and a more efficient way to support student communication. The
            college&apos;s openness to trying new digital solutions helped Unibuzz refine our implementation model, reduce onboarding friction and
            think more seriously about how to support institutions rather than simply expecting them to adopt a new app on their own.
          </BlogParagraph>
          <BlogParagraph>
            That is why this partnership feels important. It shows the direction Unibuzz believes higher education should move in: not more scattered
            apps, not more isolated WhatsApp groups, and not more invisible campus activity — but a verified, organised and student-first digital
            campus layer.
