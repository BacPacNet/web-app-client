        <BlogParagraph>When students compare colleges, one word usually comes first:</BlogParagraph>
        <BlogParagraph bold>placements.</BlogParagraph>
        <BlogParagraph>
          That is understandable. Students want to know whether a college can help them get a good job, internship, or career start after graduation.
        </BlogParagraph>
        <BlogParagraph>But there is one mistake many applicants make.</BlogParagraph>
        <BlogParagraph>They treat placements like something that happens only at the end of college.</BlogParagraph>
        <BlogParagraph>
          In reality, placement readiness is built over four years. It comes from academics, yes, but also from projects, clubs, hackathons,
          internships, communication skills, teamwork, seniors, peer groups, and the general campus environment.
        </BlogParagraph>
        <BlogParagraph>So while comparing colleges, students should not only ask:</BlogParagraph>
        <BlogParagraph bold>What is the highest package?</BlogParagraph>
        <BlogParagraph>They should also ask:</BlogParagraph>
        <BlogParagraph bold>Will this college help me become employable?</BlogParagraph>

          <BlogParagraph>Marks and academic performance matter. No serious student should ignore academics.</BlogParagraph>
          <BlogParagraph>
            But employers also look for proof that a student can think, communicate, work in a team, solve problems, learn quickly, and take
            initiative.
          </BlogParagraph>
          <BlogParagraph>
            According to the National Association of Colleges and Employers Job Outlook 2025 survey, nearly 90% of employers said they look for
            evidence of problem-solving skills on student resumes. Nearly 80% said they look for teamwork skills. Written communication, initiative,
            work ethic and technical skills were also important to at least 70% of responding employers.
          </BlogParagraph>
          <BlogParagraph>This matters because these skills are not built only by attending lectures.</BlogParagraph>

          <BlogBulletList intro="They are often built when students:">
            <BlogBulletItem>Work on technical projects</BlogBulletItem>
            <BlogBulletItem>Participate in hackathons</BlogBulletItem>
            <BlogBulletItem>Join coding clubs</BlogBulletItem>
            <BlogBulletItem>Lead student societies</BlogBulletItem>
            <BlogBulletItem>Organize events</BlogBulletItem>
            <BlogBulletItem>Play team sports</BlogBulletItem>
            <BlogBulletItem>Work with seniors and peers</BlogBulletItem>
            <BlogBulletItem>Present ideas in front of others</BlogBulletItem>
            <BlogBulletItem>Solve real problems outside the classroom</BlogBulletItem>
          </BlogBulletList>
          <BlogParagraph>
            This is why campus life is not just “extra.” For many students, it becomes the training ground for future careers.
          </BlogParagraph>
        </BlogSection>

        <BlogSection title="Career Readiness Is Bigger Than Syllabus Completion">
          <BlogParagraph>
            NACE defines career readiness through eight broad competencies: career and self-development, communication, critical thinking, equity and
            inclusion, leadership, professionalism, teamwork, and technology.
          </BlogParagraph>
          <BlogParagraph>Look at that list carefully.</BlogParagraph>
          <BlogParagraph>
            Only one part is directly about technical knowledge. The rest includes how students work, think, communicate, lead, behave, collaborate
            and grow.
          </BlogParagraph>
          <BlogParagraph>That is why college selection should not be only about the syllabus, the building, or the ranking.</BlogParagraph>
          <BlogParagraph>
            Applicants should ask whether a college gives students enough chances to practise these things in real situations.

          title="Why Hackathons Matter for Engineering Students"

          imageAlt="Hackathons for engineering students"
        >
          <BlogParagraph>For engineering students, hackathons can be especially useful.</BlogParagraph>
          <BlogParagraph>A hackathon forces students to do many things at once:</BlogParagraph>
          <BlogBulletList>
            <BlogBulletItem>understand a problem quickly</BlogBulletItem>
            <BlogBulletItem>work with a team</BlogBulletItem>
            <BlogBulletItem>divide responsibilities</BlogBulletItem>
            <BlogBulletItem>build something under time pressure</BlogBulletItem>
            <BlogBulletItem>debug and improve ideas</BlogBulletItem>
            <BlogBulletItem>present the final solution</BlogBulletItem>
            <BlogBulletItem>accept feedback</BlogBulletItem>
          </BlogBulletList>
          <BlogParagraph>These are very close to real workplace skills.</BlogParagraph>
          <BlogParagraph>
            A 2024 review on hackathons in education found that hackathons can enhance teamwork, creativity and real-world problem-solving, while
            making learning more practical and engaging.
          </BlogParagraph>
          <BlogParagraph>This does not mean every hackathon automatically leads to a job. That would be an overclaim.</BlogParagraph>
          <BlogParagraph>
            But a student who regularly participates in hackathons may build stronger confidence, better project experience, and more practical proof
            of skills than a student who only studies theory.

          title="Clubs and Societies Build Skills Students Do Not Always Notice"
          image="https://unibuzz-uploads.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/timeline/68e8e63d799d9b0a2790f8da/2-2-de246771-846c-4133-a4b6-74027c913eef.jpg"
          imageAlt="Clubs and societies"
        >
          <BlogParagraph>Many students think clubs are only for fun.</BlogParagraph>
          <BlogParagraph>Sometimes they are. And that is fine.</BlogParagraph>
          <BlogParagraph>But clubs can also build useful career skills without students realizing it.</BlogParagraph>
          <BlogParagraph>For example:</BlogParagraph>
          <BlogBulletList>
            <BlogBulletItem>A coding club helps students practise problem-solving and peer learning.</BlogBulletItem>
            <BlogBulletItem>A robotics club helps students build hardware and software projects.</BlogBulletItem>
            <BlogBulletItem>A debate society improves communication and confidence.</BlogBulletItem>
            <BlogBulletItem>A cultural club teaches teamwork, planning and event execution.</BlogBulletItem>
            <BlogBulletItem>A sports team teaches discipline, leadership and pressure handling.</BlogBulletItem>
            <BlogBulletItem>An entrepreneurship cell helps students understand ideas, markets and pitching.</BlogBulletItem>
            <BlogBulletItem>A placement or career community helps students prepare for interviews and internships.</BlogBulletItem>
          </BlogBulletList>
          <BlogParagraph>These experiences become stories students can later use in interviews.</BlogParagraph>
          <BlogParagraph>
            When an interviewer asks, &quot;Tell me about a time you worked in a team,&quot; the answer rarely comes from a textbook. It usually comes
            from a project, club, competition, event, internship, or campus experience.

        >
          <BlogParagraph>Most applicants cannot properly see campus life before joining a college.</BlogParagraph>
          <BlogParagraph>They usually depend on:</BlogParagraph>
          <BlogBulletList>
            <BlogBulletItem>college websites</BlogBulletItem>
            <BlogBulletItem>admission brochures</BlogBulletItem>
            <BlogBulletItem>Google search results</BlogBulletItem>
            <BlogBulletItem>YouTube reviews</BlogBulletItem>
            <BlogBulletItem>Instagram pages</BlogBulletItem>
            <BlogBulletItem>one or two people they already know</BlogBulletItem>
          </BlogBulletList>
          <BlogParagraph>These sources are useful, but incomplete.</BlogParagraph>
          <BlogParagraph>
            They do not always show whether student groups are active, whether technical events are happening, whether seniors are helping juniors, or
            whether the college actually has a living campus culture.
          </BlogParagraph>
          <BlogParagraph>This is where a digital campus can help.</BlogParagraph>
        </BlogSection>

        <BlogSection title="Explore the Campus Before You Choose">
          <BlogParagraph>
            Unibuzz is building a verified digital campus space where students, faculty, admins and applicants can discover campus communities in a
            more structured way.
          </BlogParagraph>
          <BlogParagraph>For applicants, this means college discovery can move beyond static information.</BlogParagraph>
          <BlogParagraph>Instead of only reading &quot;this college has clubs,&quot; students should be able to explore:</BlogParagraph>
          <BlogBulletList>
            <BlogBulletItem>which groups exist</BlogBulletItem>
            <BlogBulletItem>what students are posting</BlogBulletItem>
            <BlogBulletItem>which events are happening</BlogBulletItem>
            <BlogBulletItem>what official updates are shared</BlogBulletItem>
            <BlogBulletItem>how active the student community is</BlogBulletItem>
            <BlogBulletItem>which technical, cultural or placement groups are visible</BlogBulletItem>
            <BlogBulletItem>how campus communication actually works</BlogBulletItem>
          </BlogBulletList>
          <BlogBulletList intro="Currently, Unibuzz partnered colleges include:">
            <BlogBulletItem>KIET Group of Institutions, Ghaziabad</BlogBulletItem>
            <BlogBulletItem>Aggarwal College, Ballabgarh</BlogBulletItem>
          </BlogBulletList>

          <BlogParagraph>
            For students exploring these colleges, Unibuzz can help show the kind of campus ecosystem that does not always appear clearly in rankings
            or admission posters.
